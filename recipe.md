Step 1) Peel the skin off the potatoes and trim off the potatoes and rinse it in water. Trim off the edges to get equal sized fries otherwise you can leave them.
Then slice the potatoes vertically and then cut then into medium sized stick. Do not cut too thin if the stick is thin then the fries will become very hard on the outside
Now immediately after slicing add it to cold water to prevent from discoloring and continue with the rest of the potatoes.


Step 2) Now the next step is to leave the potatoes in water for minimum 15-20 min  or you can also refrigerate it overnight. This is the fundamental first step of making proper french fries. The soaking process removes the starch on the outside of the potato, this helps to remove the excess starch from the potatoes and it  stays crispy when we fry them.

Step 3) Now after soaking blanch the potatoes. Heat water in a bowl and add salt mix it once and then add the potatoes,Soaking in hot water softens the potatoes so it remains soft at the inside. let it soak for 5 - 7 minutes.

Step 4) Now after 7 minutes remove the potatoes form water and pat it dry with kitchen  towel or paper towel to remove the excels moisture completely.


Step 5) The secret in every perfect fries to is double fry them . So for the first time we need to fry the potatoes at low temperature 300-325 F for 3 - 4 minutes. This time we are not looking for any color change. Fry it in small batches, do not over crowed them , leaves space between the potatoes and fry it for just 3-4 minutes.
Take it off from the oil and keep it on a wire rack.Continue the same with rest of the batches,.
Now after frying let it cool for 10-20 minutes.
Check the temperature of the oil by placing one stick it should not bubble up high.


Step 6) Now at this point after frying once we can freeze it and fry it again whenever you want. I always make it in large quantity and freeze the rest so whenever needed we can immediately take if from the freezer and fry.

Step 7) Once the fries are cooled completely it time to do the second frying. Increase the temperature to 350- 375 degrees an fry it until they develop nice golden color on the outsides. 
This time oil should be hot enough to form more bubbles once placed in the oil. 

Now the fries are nice and crisp drain the excess oil and place it on a wire rack. Finally season it with salt or you can also add any seasoning of your choice.Our Crispy french fries is ready to be enjoyed with tomato Ketchup.
